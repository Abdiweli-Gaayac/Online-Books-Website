# Images Folder

This folder is intended for book cover images.

## Placeholder Images Needed:
- book1.jpg
- book2.jpg
- book3.jpg
- book4.jpg
- (and more as needed)

You can replace the emoji placeholders in the HTML with actual book cover images by:
1. Adding your book cover images to this folder
2. Updating the HTML to use `<img src="images/book1.jpg" alt="Book Title">` instead of the emoji divs

Currently, the website uses emoji placeholders (📖, 📚, etc.) which work well for prototyping and don't require actual image files.
